## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the relationship between **fork**, **origin**, and **upstream** repositories.
- Configure an **upstream remote** for your forked repository.
- **Sync changes** from the upstream repository to your fork.
- Resolve **merge conflicts** that may arise during synchronization.


## 📖 Understanding the Fork Workflow

When you fork a repository, you create three distinct versions:

1. **Upstream**: The original repository (owned by someone else)
2. **Origin**: Your fork of the repository (on GitHub, in your account)
3. **Local**: Your cloned copy on your computer

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Upstream      │  ← Original repository
│  (original/main)│
└────────┬────────┘
         │ (you forked from here)
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│   Origin        │  ← Your fork on GitHub
│  (yourname/main)│
└────────┬────────┘
         │ (you cloned from here)
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│   Local         │  ← Your computer
│  (local clone)  │
└─────────────────┘
```


## 🔧 Initial Setup: Adding the Upstream Remote

Before you can sync, you need to configure the upstream remote. You only need to do this **once** per cloned repository.

### Step 1: Check Your Current Remotes

```bash
git remote -v
```

**Expected output:**
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git (push)
```

If you already have the upstream, you can skip to "Syncing Your Fork".

### Step 2: Add the Upstream Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME.git
```

Replace `ORIGINAL-OWNER` and `REPO-NAME` with the actual upstream repository details.

### Step 3: Verify the New Upstream

```bash
git remote -v
```

**Expected output:**
```
origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME.git (push)
```


## 🔄 Syncing Your Fork

Follow these steps whenever you want to update your fork with the latest changes from upstream.

### Method 1: Fetch and Merge (Recommended)

This method gives you more control and allows you to review changes before merging.

#### Step 1: Fetch Upstream Changes

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

This downloads all new commits from the upstream repository without modifying your local files.

#### Step 2: Switch to Your Main Branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

(Replace `main` with `master` if that's your default branch name)

#### Step 3: Merge Upstream Changes

```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

This integrates the upstream changes into your local main branch.

#### Step 4: Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin main
```

This updates your fork on GitHub with the synced changes.


### Method 2: Pull (Quick Method)

For a faster approach, you can use `git pull`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

**Note:** `git pull` is essentially `git fetch` + `git merge` combined.


### Method 3: Rebase (Advanced)

If you want a cleaner, linear history without merge commits:

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Use `--force-with-lease` with caution. It rewrites history and should only be used on branches where you're the sole contributor.


## 🌿 Syncing a Feature Branch

If you're working on a feature branch and want to incorporate upstream changes:

```bash
# Ensure your main branch is synced first
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# Update your feature branch
git checkout your-feature-branch
git merge main
# OR use rebase for cleaner history:
# git rebase main
```


## 🔍 Common Scenarios and Solutions

### Scenario 1: Your Fork is Behind by Multiple Commits

**Solution:** Simply follow the standard sync process. Git will fast-forward your branch if you haven't made local changes.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### Scenario 2: You Have Local Changes

If you have uncommitted changes, stash them first:

```bash
git stash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
git stash pop
```

### Scenario 3: Merge Conflicts

If conflicts occur during merging:

```bash
# After git merge upstream/main shows conflicts
git status  # See which files have conflicts

# Open the conflicting files and resolve manually
# Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>

# After resolving all conflicts:
git add .
git commit -m "Merge upstream changes and resolve conflicts"
git push origin main
```

### Scenario 4: Checking Sync Status

To see how far behind your fork is:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git log HEAD..upstream/main --oneline
```

This shows commits in upstream that aren't in your local branch.


## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Sync Regularly**: Update your fork frequently to minimize merge conflicts.
   
2. **Never Commit Directly to Main**: Work on feature branches and keep your main branch clean and synced.

3. **Sync Before Starting New Work**: Always sync with upstream before creating a new feature branch.

4. **Check Before Pushing**: Review changes with `git log` or `git diff` before pushing.

5. **Use Descriptive Commit Messages**: When resolving conflicts, explain what was merged and how conflicts were resolved.


## 🚀 Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# One-time setup
git remote add upstream <upstream-url>

# Regular sync workflow
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# Check sync status
git fetch upstream
git status
git log HEAD..upstream/main --oneline

# Remove upstream remote (if needed)
git remote remove upstream
```


## 🛠️ Practical Exercise

1. **Find an open-source project** on GitHub and fork it
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine
3. **Add the upstream remote** using the original repository URL
4. **Fetch and merge** changes from upstream
5. **Create a feature branch** and make a small change
6. **Sync your main branch** again with upstream
7. **Merge main into your feature branch** to incorporate upstream changes

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "fatal: 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository"  
**Solution**: You need to add the upstream remote first with `git remote add upstream <url>`

**Problem**: "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by X commits"  
**Solution**: Push your changes with `git push origin main`

**Problem**: "refusing to merge unrelated histories"  
**Solution**: Use `git merge upstream/main --allow-unrelated-histories` (rare, usually only needed for incorrectly initialized repos)

**Problem**: Can't push after rebase  
**Solution**: If you used rebase, you need to force push: `git push origin main --force-with-lease`

**Remember**: The key to successful collaboration is keeping your fork in sync. Make it a habit to sync before starting any new work! 🎉
